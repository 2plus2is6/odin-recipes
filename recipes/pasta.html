        <h3>How to make <strong> PASTA ?</strong> </h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> These buttered noodles are simple and quick. Pasta is tossed with butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese.
            <br>A
            wonderful recipe to make when you don't feel like making a trip to the grocery store. <br> I used what I had
            on
            hand and it worked like a charm.

    <strong> Ingredients : </strong>
    <ol>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>

        <strong>Recipe : </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a skillet over medium-low heat. Melt butter with garlic very slowly to avoid burning the
                garlic. Season with parsley, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Add cooked pasta to the skillet and toss until well coated with butter. Increase the heat to medium and
                cook until pasta is heated through and has absorbed some of the butter. Adjust seasonings if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>

        </ul>
